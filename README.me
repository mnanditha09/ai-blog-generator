# AI Blog Generator – Take-Home Project
 
This is a simple Python + Flask app I built that takes a keyword, fetches some SEO data (mocked for now), and asks OpenAI to draft a full blog post with that keyword in mind.  
It also automatically generates a fresh post every day for a default topic.

---

## What This App Can Do

- Let you generate blog posts with just a keyword (via a simple `/generate` endpoint)
- Add fake SEO data to give context to the post
- Plug in affiliate links (as placeholders for now)
- Automatically write a blog post once a day using a scheduler
- Save everything nicely in a folder as Markdown files
